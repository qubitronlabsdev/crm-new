# Travel CRM Frontend Implementation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Travel CRM frontend implementation built with React, following the established architecture and using the existing UI components.

## Project Overview

The Travel CRM frontend has been built as a sophisticated, scalable SaaS interface that follows the established architectural patterns and leverages existing components. The implementation includes three core modules:

1. **Lead Management** - Capture and qualify potential customers
2. **Quotation Management** - Build detailed itineraries with pricing
3. **Booking & Operations** - Manage confirmed trips and operations

## Architectural Principles Followed

### 1. File Structure

- **Pages**: All pages are in `src/pages/` following the pattern `pages/{Module}/{Action}.jsx`
- **Features**: Complex components and logic are in `src/features/{Module}/components/`
- **State Management**: Global state in `src/stores/`, feature-specific state in `src/features/{Module}/store/`

### 2. Component Architecture

- Uses existing UI components from `components/ui/`
- Leverages shared components like `Page`, `Breadcrumbs`, etc.
- Maintains consistent styling with Tailwind CSS

### 3. State Management

- **Global UI State**: `useAppStore` for sidebar, notifications
- **Form State**: React Hook Form with Yup validation
- **Complex Feature State**: Zustand stores (e.g., `useItineraryStore`)

## Technical Implementation

### State Management Architecture

```javascript
// Global App State
const useAppStore = create((set) => ({
  sidebarCollapsed: false,
  notifications: [],
  // ... actions
}));

// Feature-Specific State (Itinerary)
const useItineraryStore = create((set, get) => ({
  days: [],
  markup: 20,
  getTotalNetCost: () => {
    /* calculation */
  },
  getTotalWithMarkup: () => {
    /* calculation */
  },
  // ... actions
}));
```

### Form Validation Example

```javascript
const leadSchema = yup.object({
  customer_name: yup.string().required("Customer name is required"),
  customer_phone: yup.string().required("Phone number is required"),
  customer_email: yup
    .string()
    .email("Invalid email")
    .required("Email is required"),
  destination: yup.string().required("Destination is required"),
  budget: yup.number().min(0).required("Budget is required"),
  // ... other fields
});
```

## Integration with Inertia.js

While this implementation uses React Router for demonstration, it's designed to work seamlessly with Inertia.js. Here's how to adapt:

### Form Submissions

```javascript
// Current (React Router simulation)
const navigate = useNavigate();
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
navigate("/leads");

// Inertia.js Implementation
import { router } from "@inertiajs/react";
router.post("/leads", data);
```

### Data Loading

```javascript
// Current (Mock data)
const [leads] = useState(mockLeads);

// Inertia.js Implementation
export default function LeadsIndex({ leads }) {
  // leads data comes from Laravel backend via Inertia
}
```

### Navigation

```javascript
// Current (React Router)
<Link to="/leads/create">

// Inertia.js Implementation
<Link href="/leads/create">
```
