In the all Leads page you have to do the following adjustments 
  1. Create a single large filter button which when clicked opens up a popup/dialog with multiple filters inside it that filters the leads table
   -> Filter by Source
   -> Filter by Agent Assigned
   -> Filtered by Created At
   -> Filter by Travel Destination (This will be a react-select dropdown) with the functionality of the user being able to type inside the search box & select a destination based on the result of the search 

  2. Create a single large Sort button which when clicked opens up a popup/dialog with multiple sorting options inside it that sorts the leads table 
    -> Sort by Date (Created_At date , updated_at date) note:- these two fields will be come from the backend and we have to display it in the table as well 

    => Sort by lead Priority 
    => Sort by travel date

  3. Remove the Save to draft functionality from Create Lead 
  4. I want the filter & sort mega dropdown component to be placed right at the end where we have written 
  All Leads ({leads.meta.total}) use flex w-full & jsutify-between for this 

  Also prepare the silhoutte for api integration to leads table that mocks get leads api 


I want the following patches to be done in lead details page 
  -> show all the details of a particular lead inside it's view details page 
  -> Option to add a new quotation 
  -> Fully functional Add Notes feature ( The sales person viewing a lead shall be able to add notes for that particular lead that shall be stored in the database in the future )
  -> Quotation History Tracking timeline 
  -> A fully functional Lead Progress tracking timeline that updates based on the Lead_Status with giving the user the freedom to upadate the lead-status in the timeline part also so that the sales person can change the status of the lead in the view leads page as well

  the design should be easy to understand compact but readable & the flow should be easy to follow along
