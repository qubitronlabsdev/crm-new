Now we have a new flow for that you have to modify the entire application's flow accordingly 

In the create Lead form we will only show these fields -> 
  name: yup.string().required("Name is required"),
  email: yup.string().email("Invalid email").required("Email is required"),
  phone: yup.string().required("Phone number is required"),
  agent_assignment: yup.string().required("Agent assignment is required"),
  status: yup.string().required("Status is required"),
  priority: yup.string().required("Priority is required"),
  lead_source: yup.string().required("Lead source is required"),

and here we will have the next button when we will click on that it will first hit the create lead api & if the result is successful only then redirect to the create quotations page 

In the create quotations page we will have the following form fields which will be categorized into different steps
