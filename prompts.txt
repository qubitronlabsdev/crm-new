Flow of the lead Management of Crm 

We will be needing a tabs based switching system that will work by synching the url & the sidebar tab's active status, the flow will be like this which i'm giving you below

In the leads Management Part we will show the following routes in the side bar Under the category of Leads 

Leads 
-> All Leads (This will be a table that will show data of all the leads, i.e., Fresh Leads, Converted Leads, Postponed Leads)
-> Fresh Leads (This will be a table of only the fresh leads, whenever the user will create a new lead whose Lead Status field is 'fresh' [Note: 'fresh' will be the default value of the Lead Status field] in the Create New lead form that lead will be added to the Fresh Lead Table)
-> Converted Leads (This table will show the data of those leads whose Lead Status will be set to 'converted' & this will only happen when we have given quotation of that particular lead, means after giving quotation to a lead it's lead status will be auto-matically converted into 'converted')
-> Postponed Leads (Those leads whose Lead Status is converted to postponed that will go inside PostPoned Leads table)


** All leads page **

    Filter by
