for the children & children age I want that the children age to be a multi-select dropdown which will be directly related to the number of children field this children age field will work like this 
suppose if the children field someone input 5 then the children age field will become a multiselect in which inside the dropdown we will have a label like
child 1 age ---> then an input field infront of it where we can write his age
child 2 age ---> then an input field infront of it where we can write his age
child 3 age ---> then an input field infront of it where we can write his age

and once when we are done inputting the ages of all the children through that multi select dropdown the select trigger will show the ages of all the children respectively
